# C Data Structures
A simple, thorough, and educational data structure library written in C.

This project is a personal educational exercise to implement common data structures from scratch with a focus on:
* **Generic API:** Using `void*` and function pointers to handle any data type.
* **Robustness:** Implementing full error-checking (NULL guards, allocation failures).
* **Clarity:** Writing clean, well-commented, and well-structured code.

This is as much a usable library as it is a learning exercise -

## Data Structures

* **HashTable:** A generic, open-addressed (quadratic probing) hash table with tombstone deletion and automatic resizing.
